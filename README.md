Project made to connect Farmers to Retailers

The web app is made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python-Flask, MySQL.
The app helps the farmers to sell their goods to the retailers without the use of middle man.
The farmers post their avaliable goods on the platform and the retailers can buy the goods from it.
Even the Retailer can post a requirment of his and any farmer can fulfil the request.
